This project is mainly focussed on the Convulational Neural Network Model to classify various types of weather disasters and its severity analysis. There are lots of future scope to make it a base and solve lots of real world problems and help to fight against the natural calamities. Deep learning model is being made here and the data sets which i used are hereby named as " Experimental Train Dataset " and "Experimental Validate Dataset". I any one wanting to colaborate in this project please feel free to connect me through my mail id " aniruddhakarmokar10@gmail.com " . Hope you will enjoy the project ðŸ˜‰.
